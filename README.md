# Symbiont - An Open Source Self-hosted RAG App 🌐

Welcome to Symbiont, the premier RAG (Retrieval Argument Generation)-based application designed for secure, self-hosted deployment on personal or organizational servers. Built with privacy and user control in mind, Symbiont ensures that sensitive data is managed securely without requiring transmission to third-party servers, except when interacting with LLM (Large Language Model) providers such as OpenAI or Anthropic.
Symbiont is a free and Open Source alternative to https://jenni.ai/ and https://paperpal.com/ (we are a few features behind).
